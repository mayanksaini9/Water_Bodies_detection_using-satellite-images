# 🌊 Water Bodies Detection from Satellite Images using DeepLabV3+

This project performs **semantic segmentation** to detect water bodies from satellite images using a **DeepLabV3+** model with an **Xception backbone** in TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is from [Kaggle - Satellite Images of Water Bodies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies). It contains:
- `images/` folder with satellite images.
- `masks/` folder with corresponding binary masks (1 for water body, 0 for background).
- Total image-mask pairs: **2841**

## 🧠 Model

We used the **DeepLabV3+** architecture with the **Xception** backbone, a powerful deep CNN designed for segmentation tasks.

### Key Features:
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, zoom, width/height shift, flipping, etc.
- **Batch Normalization**: Added after convolution layers for training stability.
- **Dice Loss**: Custom loss function for imbalanced segmentation data.
- **EarlyStopping**, **ModelCheckpoint**, **ReduceLROnPlateau** used during training.
